# PseudoNumbers-MTechLabs <br/>

Generate a random writer that writes pseudo strings (with at least 50% probability of generating “MARUTI” keyword. Note that we are strictly looking at "MARUTI" keyword only as a single value not the MARUTI keyword inside a random string) into two separate files at regular interval of time.        

It should have capability to monitor both the files and count the total number for occurrences for  “MARUTI” keyword by each file and write output to "counts.log" file.
